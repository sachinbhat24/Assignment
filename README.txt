QUESTION NO: 3
QUESTION TITLE: SIGN UP PROGRAM THAT ASKS USER TO ENTER USER_NAME, PASSWORD AND NAME.

PROGRAM IMPLEMENTATION: PROGRAM(SOURCE CODE) IS WRITTEN IN "C" WITH FILE NAME "asn2_2.c". THIS PROGRAM ASKS THE USER TO ENTER USER_NAME ,PASSWORD AND NAME AND RECORDS IN THE FILE. IF SELECTED USER_NAME ALREADY EXISTS IN THE FILE IT ASKS THE USER TO SELECT OTHER USER_NAME. ONCE ONE SET OF USER_NAME, PASSWORD AND NAME ARE ENTERED PROGRAM TERMINATES WITH A MESSAGE "SUCCESSFULLY SUBMITTED".
LOG FILE IS ALSO IMPLEMENTED WHICH RECORDS USERNAME AND PASSED FOR A PARTICULAR EXECUTION OF PROGRAM. ITS WRITTEN INTO FILE UNDER "W" MODE.

ASSUMPTIONS:

1)THE INPUT IS GIVEN IN THE FORMAT -f <filename> -l <logfile>.
2)THE PROGRAM TERMINATES ONCE, USER_NAME THAT DOESN'T EXIST IN FILE AND ANY PASSWORD IS GIVEN.
3)USER_NAME SHOULD BE OF LENGTH BETWEEN 3-20 CHARACTERS AND PASSWORD OF LENGTH 3-15.
4)FILE NAME PASSED IN COMMAND LINE SHOULD EXISTS BEFORE BEING PASSED. f.txt file is attached as default filename.
5)PROGRAM IS CASE SENSITIVE.


PROGRAM EXECUTION:

PROGRAM SHOULD BE COMPILED. AND THEN GIVE COMMAND ./a.out -f <filename> -l <anyfilename>.
filename preferably f.txt or any file that already exists.


BUGS:

IF ALL ASSUMPTIONS ARE CONSIDERED I DON'T THINK THERE IS ANY BUGS.
